# Form Generator

This is another pet project, I hope to collaborate on this with friends.
Vanilla everything, I know some of my friends hate javascript so I am making them write vanillaJS here if they wish to collab ðŸ˜‚

What I wish to accomplish here, is to have a drag and drop form designer that will spit code on the other side, for now it will be CSS, HTML and Javascript output,
but maybe over time others like react, Angular etc can be added on... Ambition?

## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Continued Delevelopment

As mentioned earlier, I hope to output code for different frontend frameworks, maybe... just maybe later add the tests as well, see if the form works?
Send form data to your specified url or something
